# MATHEMATICAL MODEL UVGI
Mathematical modeling of the UV disinfection process provides a basis for sizing ultraviolet disinfection equipment and for interpreting test results.
# UV Lamp Modeling
The model used here is based on
thermal radiation view factors, which define the amount of diffuse radiation transmitted
from one surface to another (Modest 1993). Figure 7.1 illustrates a lamp
modeled as a cylinder where the planar area at which the UV irradiance is to be
determined is perpendicular to the axis and is at the edge of the cylinder.
The fraction of radiative irradiance that leaves the cylindrical body and arrives at
a differential area
# UV Disinfection Modeling
The ultraviolet disinfection processmay involve simple exponential decay, or a more
complex function composed of two or more decay processes, a shoulder or delayed
response, and photoreactivation.
# UV Exposure Dose
Microbes exposed to UV irradiation are subject to an exposure dose (fluence) that
is a function of the irradiance multiplied by the exposure time.
# Single Stage Decay
The primary model used to evaluate the survival of microorganisms subject to UV
exposure is the classical exponential decay model. This is a first-order decay rate
model and is generally adequate for most UVGI design purposes provided the UV
dose is within first order parameters. This is because disinfection rates of 90â€“99%
can generally be achieved in the first stage of decay, and this is adequate for most
design purposes.
